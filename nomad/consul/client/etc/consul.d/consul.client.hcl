# server
# This flag is used to control if an agent is in server or client mode. When provided,
# an agent will act as a Consul server. Each Consul cluster must have at least one
# server and ideally no more than 5 per datacenter. All servers participate in the Raft
# consensus algorithm to ensure that transactions occur in a consistent, linearizable
# manner. Transactions modify cluster state, which is maintained on all server nodes to
# ensure availability in the case of node failure. Server nodes also participate in a
# WAN gossip pool with server nodes in other datacenters. Servers act as gateways to
# other datacenters and forward traffic as appropriate.
server = false

# retry_join
# Similar to -join but allows retrying a join until it is successful. Once it joins 
# successfully to a member in a list of members it will never attempt to join again.
# Agents will then solely maintain their membership via gossip. This is useful for
# cases where you know the address will eventually be available. This option can be
# specified multiple times to specify multiple agents to join. The value can contain
# IPv4, IPv6, or DNS addresses. In Consul 1.1.0 and later this can be set to a go-sockaddr
# template. If Consul is running on the non-default Serf LAN port, this must be specified
# as well. IPv6 must use the "bracketed" syntax. If multiple values are given, they are
# tried and retried in the order listed until the first succeeds. Here are some examples:
#retry_join = ["consul.domain.internal"]
#retry_join = ["10.0.4.67"]
#retry_join = ["[::1]:8301"]
#retry_join = ["consul.domain.internal", "10.0.4.67"]
# Cloud Auto-join examples:
